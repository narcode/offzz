# off<>zz
Pool of Supercollider live coding sessions by Off<>zz for re-use, recycling and future reference.

Off<>zz is a project to unite keyboards. In this case piano/toypiano and coding (laptop keyboard).

Feel free to fork and contribute to the repository with your own supercollider files if you are also exploring the combination of acoustic instruments and coding.
